# BB, Rhys Davids, and Thanissaro all translate pada as “eulogy “or” oration” here. But I find this extremely implausible. Indian funerals are typically noisy affairs, with horns, drums, and dancing, and I doubt very much if there is a place for a serious “eulogy” as the procession is underway, leading along narrow dirt bush tracks to the cemetry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek-RTQkSBuQ. The commentary says ‘ayaṃ evaṃ sīlavā ahosi, evaṃ dussīlo’’tiādinā nayena pavattāni guṇāguṇapadāni. Which sounds frankly like a monk’s fantasy. But the commentary also says: Sarīrameva vā ettha padānīti adhippetaṃ. I’m not entirely sure of the force of this, but I think it means “Or in this context the corpse itself is intended as padani”. In any case they acknowledge the ambiguity. I think here padani has the meaning of “footprints”, which may be followed, as in MN 27. It’s a melancholy reflection: your life’s journey leads to the grave.

# dattu is a very rare term for idiot, apparently related to dandha in the sense of slow, thick. Note that both here and at MN 56 it’s put in the mouth of sectarian teachers, so should probably be distinguished from the Buddhist “fool”. I take that to be more polite. I think datta means more like “moron, cretin” etc.
