# See BB’s note for the peculiar grammar of this phrase. I take it as an idiom,. and try to express it in a way that makes sense in English. Note also that the peculiar context of this, where Citta, normally so precise in his questions, throws in a random set of dhammas and then leaves, echoes the similar passage at AN 10.27. There, the Buddha, equally randomly, says that this set of questions would stump any sectarian teacher.
