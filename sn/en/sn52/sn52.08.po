msgstr "8. The Frankincense-Tree Hut"

# The identification with salala is uncertain. It may be a variant of sallakī, which has been identified as Boswellia serrata, which is an Indian source of frankincense. The main textual references to salala are in the Apadanas, where salala is frequently identified as a source of fragrant flowers to offer to the Buddha. MN 93 speaks of the fire from the salala. Taken together these references suggest that a variety of frankincense tree is likely to be not too far off. Such trees, however, are fairly straggly, barely more than shrubs, and I don’t think could serve as timber. Perhaps it was used for wattle-and-daub, or else the hut was simply near the tree.
