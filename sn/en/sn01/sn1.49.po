# This idiom is also found in the Parabhava Sutta (Snp 1.6). In my view, it is slightly more specific than one might suspect; the use of iti is not the generic “thus, so”, rather it is the “recorded saying” as in itivuttaka, itihasa, etc. The phrase is not agreeing that the listener understands it the same way, but they have noted it and will remember in accord with what was said: “Okay, we get that now.”
