# I disagree with BB’s “escape” here, in which he follows Woodward’s “egress”, which was questioned by PTS dict. yātrā always has the sense of “keep on going”; this is not a question about escape, but a crisis. The stock idiom, which also concerns the body, is yātrā ca me bhavissati, i.e. it is phrased similarly. it’s part of the reflection on food, and thus directly answers the same question. So there’s no call to think the meaning is different. The problem here is that the body is bound up with suffering, so how to are we to live without suffering in a body.
