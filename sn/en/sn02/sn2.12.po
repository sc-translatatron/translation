# It seems we must translate satthipada as “ways odf teaching “or some some, following BB and PTS; also the two Chinese parallels. But I can’t help feeling this is a mistake. The reading is evidently unclear, and I wonder if it should not rather be saṭṭhipada, i.e. an abbreviation for” dvāsaṭṭhi diṭṭhigatāni brahmajāle veyyākaraṇe vuttāni bhagavatā”. We are, after all, dealing with a heretic.
