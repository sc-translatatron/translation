# BB leaves these untranslated, but they all have well established English names. In addition, the translation “milk-sap” is over-literal. While sap is loosely used of any plant liquid, correctly speaking it is a separate liquid. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sap The milky liquid—which these trees do in fact produce—is called latex. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex
