# Reading ahitaya dukkhaya, following PTS and BB. As for Bhatthalonika/matthalonika, I have no idea what it means. The only meaning I can extract from the dicts is mattha=brains. Which, okay, “salted brain” might be tasty, but i’m not sure this is what it means. Comm says Bhaṭṭhaloṇikāyāti saloṇena sattupānīyena. But I also have no idea what this means. upaniya is to infer, bring it. Is satta “beings=meat”? Then this would be meat broth as opposed to grain broth for lonasoviraka? Maybe! Either way, i find BB’s “porridge” just a bit humorous; I can’t image a thirsty man drinking porridge! Lacking a solution, the simile works fine with just three drinks.
