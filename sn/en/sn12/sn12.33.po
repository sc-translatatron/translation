# Nanavatthu is rendered by BB as “cases of knowledge”, thus taking vatthu as essentially meaningless, “item” or such. this is what the comm says “ñāṇameva ñāṇavatthūti veditabbaṃ”, but I cannot find any support for it. The PTS dict under it’s meaning 2 “object, item” lists a number of examples: niddasa-, dana-, aghata-, kusita-. Also see codana-, nijjara-, punnakiriya, sangaha-. But in each of these cases the meaning of “ground, basis” applies. It seems to me this meaning makes the current sutta more meaningful. instead of merely being an abhidhamma-type list of “cases”, it indicates that each of these things, while itself being dukkha, offers up the possibility of insight.

# BB translates dhamma as principle here, which I feel is a little confusing. Of course it is true that pattern of the truths is a principle, and this is a fine translation. However it seems to me that the primary emphasis of the term here is not its application to the truths, but it’s contrast with anvaye nanam later. the two appear in a list of four with no mention of the truths in DN 333 and DN 34. Thus I see it as having a closer affinity to the phrase ditthevadhamme. It is referring to what may be directly seen in this very life.

# See BB’s note. Text should be corrected to atītānāgate nayaṃ neti. I’m not altogether convinced by the explanation of akalika as an adverb of manner here. It seems to me rather that the list is a little odd, and should be translated as such. Re nayam neti, this is a noun/verb repetition and should be translated according to the meaning of the idiom as a whole.
