# This is one of those sentences that is straightforward in pali, and also straightforward to translate literally into English. But the resulting sentence doesn’t parse easily; it concatenates too many abstract ideas. I have broken it down and made it as concrete as possible. Note also that I use “concentrate” here, which having been freed from samadhi can be used more appropriately. regarding upadaniya and samyojaniya in the next sutta, I take these as having a stronger sense than BB. In his translation, they are merely things that can be grasped, whereas i take them, in line with CPD as things that are apt to, liable to, or “prone to” grasping. Note that BB’s translations are not really parallel. Upadaniya is things that “can be clung to”, i.e. the things are the subject of clinging. Samyojaniya are things that “can fetter”, i.e. the things are the agents that does the fettering. This difference is not found in the Pali, and my translation avoids it. “prone to being grasped “and” prone to being fettered” are admittedly clumsy, but at least the meaning is clear. It would be much better to use “graspable” for upadaniya, but we have no “fetterable”. Perhaps “bindable” could be used; it is used in programming specifically in the sense of “something that can be bound to”. But then should we replace fetter throughout with bond or binding?
