# This sutta just plonks down a series of unrelated teachings one after the other, with no attempt to connect them. BB translates as if “brahmacakkam pavatteti” introduces the passage on the five khandhas, inserting a “thus” here. It’s perfectly reasonable, and doubtless something of the sort was intended by the authors. But there’s nothing like that in the text. The introductory passage, with several variations, appears multiple times in the Anguttara, and it is always followed by the standard question as to what the content of the preceding statement is “What four”, etc. BB’s note suggests that this sutta be taken as a connection between the khandhas and PS, but the only connection is that the passages have been pasted in one after the other.
