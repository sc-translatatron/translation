# Both BB and Thanissaro translate uppadaya here as “the arising of”. However, by far the most common use of uppadaya is in the formula for the four right efforts, where, as here, it answers to the genitive of a kusala dhamma. Thus i take it in the sense of “gives rise to”. In addition, usually anuloma has a stronger meaning than “in line with” and has more a sense of “reinforces, supports”. The point then is not that the false view contradicts the Buddha’s insight (although it obviously does) but that it doesn’t help Vacchagotta.
