# Pura is glossed as nagara in the comms, but it really an earlier concept, neither city nor urban. It is a very old PIE term that refers to the “circle” of protection, perhaps just a circle of caravans, or a fenced village. In the suttas, it is never used as an ordinary term for city, but always in context such as this, which evoke the names and ideas of an older time. AS BB notes, the term is a Buddhist reformation of the old Vedic idea of Purindada, destroyer of forts, perhaps evoking the Indo-European nomads’ destruction of fortified settlements. Elsewhere we here of it only in verse, as the “fort of the Kasis”, as an occasional poetic flourish (gamagamam, pura puram), or in reference to the gods and demons, where “castle” works well.
