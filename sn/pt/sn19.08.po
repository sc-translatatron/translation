# See BB’s note for variants. I find it hard to accept that a horse trainer should be included here among what are obviously unskillful activities. And if it does just mean horse trainer, why use such an obscure term? In Sanskrit the sūta is an honorary title, usually used for a special groom functionary of a king. It seems he was some kind of herald, proclaiming the king’s deeds as he drove into battle. However, in SA 513 a 調象 “elephant trainer” is mentioned.
