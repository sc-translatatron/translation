# Horner has "rye" for kudrūsaka, but rye is a European grain. Finger millet is a widespread secondary grain in India, which grows in places rice cannot. While in Sri Lanka I learned that it is grown in the South, where it is too hot and dry for rice. But with the influence of climate change, rice will soon be unviable and finger millet, or kurukkan, will become essential. When I learned of this I was immediately reminded of this passage. I have no idea whether the word kurukkan is related to kudrusaka, but some of the other Indic terms for this grain seem to be, eg. the Pahari term "kodra", Garhwal "koda".

# Comm has "Atibyādippissantīti ativiya dippissanti, ayameva vā pāṭho" so its mainline version must have been Atibyādippissanti or similar. But this leaves unexplained the long ā in the sandhi. At the same time, the sense of dippati is not entirely clear here. RD has "flourish", MW has "prevail", but neither of these is really what it means. If anything, its basic meaning of "appear, show" contrasts more directly with antaradhayati. However, note that ādippati occurs, I think, once elsewhere in the canon, in AN 7.66, which by coincidence or not, also concerns a myth of the future. There it refers to an erupting volcano. Given that this explains the long ā, and that the unusual and emphatic form suggests a powerful meaning, I suggest that the sense "explode" (in popularity, etc.) fits here.
