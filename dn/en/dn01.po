# In line with the former reading of "judgmental", I think this passage is more gently critical of the monks than implied in previous translations. The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific, and is more active than just "giving way": they "should not do" what creates bitterness (i.e. sit around judging others). Cp MN 22, where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha's case, it has the neutral hoti, while for the mendicants it uses karaniya, as here.

# The parallel with khiddapadosika rather confuses the issue, suggesting a rendering "depraved in mind" here. However elsewhere in the suttas, manopadosa consistently means "malicious intent", MN 56, MN 93, also see mano padūseyya at MN 21 and MN 28. Thus the contrast here would seem to be greed vs hate.
