# Note the text starts to use ayasma here for Cunda. There seems to be some confusion felt between the monk attendant Cundaka and Cunda. But the usage here seems to be driven by grammar. Earlier avuso was used, but as an indeclinable it doesn't work in instrumental, so apparently ayasmata is the fallback instrumental form; they are both from the same root.

# Padesavattī is difficult. Anandajoti has "Existing in the realm of the right Teaching" evidently taking vatti in the sense of exist, be present, and padesa as a place. Walshe more poetically has "To roam the realm of wisdom’s law". Neither of these agree with comm, which has "Padesavattīti padese vipassanāmagge pavattanto". However the Sanskrit has āryasya dharmasya pradeśavaktā, where vaktā means "speaker" and pradeśa presumably has the sense "pointing out". Thus, "I have been the teacher who points out the noble teaching." While disagreeing in details, this agrees with the thrust of the comm, in that it is to do with teaching. BTW, note that the Skt text has complete verses here and is far more satisfactory. It looks like the Pali has suffered loss of a couple of padas.
