Moreover, the logic flows better if we end it here. The next line refers to the "explanation of the teaching", which must mean Gopaka's teaching.

# RD, MW, and Thanissaro all take this as "same doctrine", etc. This is probably right, but it is not a simple as it seems. Normally ekanta has the sense of "exclusively, solely". That doesn't make sense here, and the text may be corrupt. Skt at SF 241 has na haiva sarvasatvā ekakāmā ekacchandāḥ, which is more expected. Taken literally, ekanta could mean "of one aim". This would then be a slightly different question: "(though we know that they appear different, nevertheless) is the end result of spiritual practice the same?" It seems comm has this in mind at least for the first term, but it is unclear to me whether it intended this analysis to be applied to each term: "Ekantavādāti ekoyeva anto vādassa etesaṃ, na dvedhā gatavādāti ekantavādā, ekaññeva vadantīti pucchati.
