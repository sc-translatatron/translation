# bhavasankhara occurs only here and in the verses where the Buddha relinquishes the “life force”. There, as it refers to an act made by the Buddha towards the end of his life, it cannot mean “intention leading to rebirth”. It must be a synonym of ayusankhara, and mean the “will to live”, “life force”, or something of the sort. In the current sutta, as per BB’s note it is not obvious in what sense intention would be meant here. The “sarira” refers, so far as i know, solely to the olarika kaya, so how are we to consider other realms? Normally, of course, ponobbhavika means “leading to rebirth”, but here I think it’s better to think of it in terms of being associated with ongoing rebirth.
