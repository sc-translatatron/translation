# BB has “discernment” for patibhana. I don’t think there’s justification for this rendering anywhere, but here it is incomprehensible. This is a rare instance where it’s better to rely on the Comm: Paṭibhānanti kathetukāmatā vuccati (Patibhana means the desire to speak). This is, indeed, a strong urge that’s hard to suppress when it comes up. Compare how it is used, say, in SN 8.6: Vangisa has an “urge”, or perhaps “inspiration”, that compels him to speak up. Perhaps we could use"poetic inspiration. Cp. the notion that the Vedas were “inspired” by voices of the gods.
