# See BB’s comment here. This is a good example of what I think is a common mistake in reading the comms. I think their glosses are too readily taken as substitutes for words, when they are better read as explanations or elaborations. In this case “gocara” has a strong meaning in such contexts of “place to go for alms”, and the comm would not feel the need to explain this. However, the question arises: is it prohibited to go to such people for alms? Obviously not, since the Buddha for example accepted a meal from Ambapali. So what it must mean is “going frequently or regularly to such places for alms”. So “visiting frequently” is not a replacement for “alms-resort”, it is an explanation of the specific case. Also notice BB’s rendering of thullakumari as unmarried women, thus omitting the “thulla”. Also I don’t know that woman is really right for kumari, they are usually teens or younger. There’s a modern idiom “thick girls”, which means the same thing.
