# This is apparently the only occurrence of paritthi and parakumari, and it is not commented on by Comm or BB. The meaning is straightforward enough and it should obviously be read beside the standard passage on the five precepts, for example AN 10.21. There, the emphasis is on guardianship. It is considered to be a transgression if a woman is under protection. Note the list of those who she might be under protection of: mother, father, brother, sister, family. Surprisingly, it is not a gendered list, and the husband only appears towards the end of it. Nor is there any implication, here or elsewhere, that a woman *should* be under one or other of these forms of protection, such as we find in some later Hindu texts. If a man has intercourse with a woman who is a free agent, it is not breaking precepts. It is important to avoid the impression of ownership here. Such women were not bondservants. Obviously there was some degree of restriction, but that is the case even today if a girl is under guardianship. BB’s “someone else’s women” is correct, but to me is apt to be read as implying ownership. Further, we have a problem with “kumari”. Often, of course, this just means “girl”. However the normal marriageable age at the time was 16, and there is, to my knowledge, no recognized custom of sexualizing or marrying younger girls. “Maiden” is a little archaic, but the “fair maiden” of fairy tales is, in fact, pretty much exactly what is meant here.
