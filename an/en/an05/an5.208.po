# BB uses the modern “brushing teeth”. But while toothwoods, or as more widely known, chew sticks, are somewhat obscure, they are a distinct means of cleaning the teeth. I learned how to make and use them in Thailand. And they have their own wikipedia page! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeth_cleaning_twig Check out the study here, which shows that they are as good or better than toothbrushes: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114011/

In fact the modern ayurvedic description of benefits suggest that liquorice was in fact used. Neem, another popular chew stick, is a digestive http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2008/ajan08/neem.shtml

# This sutta, and the next couple, give a good idea why ādīnava is best not rendered as “danger”. A “danger” is primarily a possible threat. The adinavas are not just possible, they are inherent in the thing. They’re a natural drawback or downside.
