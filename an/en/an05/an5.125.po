# BB has “one walks [for alms] at an improper time” for akalacari, referring to Snp 386 (Snp 389 on SC). There it does mean that, but why would walking for alms in the afternoon make you lose vitality? A common meaning of “akala” is “wrong time," unseasonable”, and I think it means that here. Also, BB's "having poor digestion" for aparinatabhoji seems to be a mistake. CPD here has "eating unripe things". See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/meaning-of-apari-atabhoji/7532/3
