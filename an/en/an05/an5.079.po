# Notice how vinaya is used in this sutta. A sudent is “vinaya-ed” in sila, citta, panna, i.e. “guided”, not “disciplined”. How do we keep the connection between that “vinaya” and this? If we use “vinaya” here, we give the impression that we’re talking about the Vinayapitaka, but that’s clearly not so. Here, the difference between “dhamma” and “vinaya” is, it seems, “theory and practice”.
