# See BB’s note for the readings. I find it very strange that brahmins are said to buy and sell brahmin women: I am not aware of this being said elsewhere. I suspect it stems from a misinterpretation of Brihadarannyaka 6.4, which parallels this very closely, where a brahman is encouraged to bribe his wife for sex when need be, using the same verb kinati. It doesn’t refer to buying a wife, certainly not selling her.
