# The language here is very specific and quite unusual. The grass called “tiriyā” is unknown elsewhere. I assume it is related to tira, “crossing”. In BHS it is kṣīrikā “milky”. The text is clearly twinning the terms nābhiyā and nabham, which latter is here preferred to the several other words for sky in Pali. Nabha can often just mean sky, atmosphere. But it has a special association with clouds, mist and rain. It is also a name for a month in the Vassa (MW). I think the overall connotation in this image is that of fertility, hence justifying “cloudy” here. I am tempted to add “navy” also, to complete the image: from his navel to the navy-blue clouds. Also, not that āhacca is unusual here and seems to imply something more forceful than just “touched”. BHS has āsadya.

# Kimi here is normally translated worm, eg BB. But Dhammika notes that kimi must sometimes mean caterpillar. And in fact it is quite common for caterpillars to have white bodies and black heads (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-30Ehg5G1IVc/TwMrSNADp0I/AAAAAAAAMOw/4QEunpJjpYc/s1600/MalayDartlet_newly_hatched_01.jpg), a sight that must have been quite reminiscent of the upasikas. Not only does this avoid the derogatroy connotations of worms, it evokes the transformative potential of the caterpillar. They have come to the Buddha to turn into butterflies! Mvu has lohitakā prāṇakā.

# See BB’s notes, and extensive use of [braces] for the uncertainty in the construction of this and previous sentences. The text seems to be corrupt. BB, however, does not consider Mvu, which here makes more sense. In place of these two sentences, it just has: yaṃ pi bhikṣavaḥ tathāgato anuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhim anabhisaṃbuddho ayaṃ tasya mahāsvapnasya vipāko, “The fulfillment of this great dream is that the Realized One became awakened in the supreme perfect awakening”. While this is straightforward linguistically, the use of vipāka here is doctrinally questionable. Surely it can’t mean “kammavipaka” as, well, there’s no kamma. Jones has “fulfillment” which works better. I’m reading tassa anabhisambodhassa against the text’s tassā abhisambodhāya here. I don’t have any linguistic justification for this. It requires correcting tassā to tassa, and inserting the negative. My concern is that the text itself is curiously silent on the question of the relation between the dream and the outcome. We read pubbanimitta from the commentaries, where it occurs no less than twelve times. Something seems to be required to make sense, yet the text itself doesn’t quite say that. The idea of dreams as foreshadowing is obviously at the least unusual, if not unique, in the EBTs. I’d rather translate in a way that imposed as little meaning as possible. Reading it in this way, the sentence is just doing the ordinary thing you’d expect from a sentence like this in the nikayas: it restates the opening. I’d rather risk a linguistic slip than be guilty of reading an entire doctrine of foreshadowing by dreams into the EBTs based on such an uncertain passage. For the same reason, in the previous segment, while it seems we can’t avoid some interpolation, rather than the explicit “foreshadowing” or similar, I use the vague “fulfills”, following Jones. If I have a vision or make a prophecy and later “fulfill” that, it doesn’t imply that the prophecy caused the result.

# For nipatitva Mvu has upajighritvā “having sniffed his feet”! (Jones translates as “kissed”. Cute, and quite Christian.) Instead of sampajjimsu it has apavidhyinsuḥ and apavijhinsuś. This is apparently Edgerton’s “aparādhyati: disappears: Mv ii.137.9 (śakuntā…) aparādhyetsuḥ, aor.; so mss., Senart em. apavidhyinsuḥ, but this could only mean were thrown away, which is completely inappropriate; in Mv ii.139.4, in identical context, mss. aparijhiṃsuḥ (°nsuḥ), Senart em. °vijhinsuḥ; read perhaps MIndic aparajjhiṃsuḥ, cf. AMg. above; in any case some form related to apa-rādh, aor., disappeared.” Jones has “went away”.
