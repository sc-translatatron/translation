# See BB’s note. He interprets anantara following the Abhidhamma idea of “instant enlightenment”, which does not exist in the suttas. I interpret this and similar phrases as essentially synonyms of akalika, sanditthika, and ditthevadhamme: in this very life. The “interval” here is not the interval between path and fruit—another inappropriate Abhidhamma concept—but between one life and the next (bhavantara).
