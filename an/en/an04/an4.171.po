# I find BB’s “bodily intention” obscure. Does it means, “the body’s own intention” (which is how it seems to be used in psychology)? Or does it mean “intention expressed via the body”? Since cetana is always a mental factor in Buddhism it must be the latter. My rendering follows the Tika: kāyasañcetanāhetūti kāyakammanimittaṃ, kāyikassa kammassa kaṭattā upacitattāti attho
