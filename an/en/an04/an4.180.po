# I suspect there’s a textual problem here. It’s unusual to end an item in a numerical list like this with dhāreyyātha, and it’s not clear why it should be added, if the sense is “you should remember this mahapadesa”. However compare the usage with chaḍḍeyyātha just above: the parallel is all too obvious. I think what it means is, not that the mahapadesa should be memorized, but that the teaching should be memorized, mirroring the “rejection” of the wrong teaching. This is exactly what the Sanskrit parallel says: (sf245) nāyaṃ dharmo nāyaṃ vinayo nedaṃ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā chorayitavyāḥ … ayaṃ dharmo’yaṃ vinaya idaṃ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ.
