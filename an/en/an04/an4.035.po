# Brahmali noted to me: “I would translate this as “In regard to the variety of paths, Sir Gotama,” not as “In regard to what is path and what is not path,” which is what Walshe has. The commentary [to DN 13] seems to support my suggestion: Esa kira ekabrāhmaṇassāpi maggaṃ ‘‘na maggo’’ti na vadati, “He certainly does not say of the path of even one brahmin that ‘It is not a path’.” This, apparently, is the usual way such compounds should be understood: have a look at compounds such as phalāphala, which can only be understood (in context) as “various kinds of fruit.””
