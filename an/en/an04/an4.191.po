# This is a curious and interesting phrase, see BB’s note. Here I have gone with the comms, though note that I don’t have Norman’s arguments with me. BB’s reading relies on a extremely rare grammatical form (neuter accusative plural in ā), and it just doesn’t read as well to me. I’m also not aware of any passage where the devas are sukhino. The comm interpretation is that the teachings are forgotten in the in-between state (!) and then “float back like shadows in a clear mirror”. (Dhammapadā plavantīti antarābhave nibbattamuṭṭhassatino, yepi pubbe sajjhāyamūlikā vācāparicitabuddhavacanadhammā, te sabbe pasanne ādāse chāyā viya plavanti, pākaṭā hutvā paññāyanti.) To me this makes psychological sense. I also thinks it fits better the structure of the text. To start with, sometimes memory spontaneously comes back. If not, something reminds you. But why would it come back hearing the teaching and not when the gods are speaking directly to you?
