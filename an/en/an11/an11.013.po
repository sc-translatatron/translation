# BB’s translation is inconsistent with AN 5.166, and moreover I find it confusing. In addition, he comments that it is hard to determine where the quote is meant to end, and does so after the recapitulation. But the next two clauses use the vocative “Nandiya” so they can’t be meditation reflections. Finally, he comments that it is not clear what the reference of the text is, but it clearly relates to AN 5.166, where it refers to mendicants who are accomplished in sila, samadhi, and panna, and enter nirodhasamapatti, but are still reborn.
