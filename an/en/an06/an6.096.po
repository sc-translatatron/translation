# BB has “sphere of the noble ones” for ariyatane. Contextually, the phrase could either look back to the former phrases, in which it would be spiritual, or forward to the following phrases, in which case it would be a more ordinary meaning. Ariya in the sense of “civilized” is rare. But at KD6, DN 16, Ud 8.6 we have: Yāvatā, ānanda, ariyaṃ āyatanaṃ, yāvatā vaṇippatho, idaṃ agganagaraṃ bhavissati pāṭaliputtaṃ. Here it must mean “civilized regions, trade routes”. Also note the grammar here, i.e. not ariyassa (or ariyanam) āyatana as required by BB’s translation.
#. VAR: paccājāti dullabhā → paccājāto dullabho (s1-3)
#. VAR: kusale dhamme chando → kusaladhammacchando (bj, s1-3, pts1)
