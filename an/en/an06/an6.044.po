# See BB’s note on this, with different interpretations offered by him and Brahmali. The exact phrase is also used in a rebirth context at AN 6.62, where it also expresses a certain ambiguity, as the monk is said to be foolish. Often evam’etam expresses an emphatic agreement “So it is!”. I think the kho pana inserted here is not just empty, but has qualifying sense. Remember, the replier in both cases is Ananda, who is very diplomatic. He’s supporting the questioner by affirming their knowledge, but expressing a certain hesitation about the motivation behind it.

# See BB’s note. This short passage is full of variants, grammatical problems, and the Chinese parallel lacks the misogynist parts. The word ammaka or ambaka means “mom, mummy”, and only occurs here and in the passage where Ambapali is called ammaka by the Licchavis. there it is clearly meant to pun with “mango”, confusing the situation even more. The Skt says that it is usually respectful, which is obviously not the case here. Perhaps we can use the modern Hinglish “auntie”.

# See BB’s note. His reading rests on slim grounds, being found in the Sinhalese texts only. Comm. reads vacisankhara, as does the Chinese parallel at SA 991: 口惡行 (akusala-vacisankhara). Moreover, I don’t think that reading makes sense. The context is speaking of mental qualities. I prefer the MN 44 explanation here: Pubbe kho, āvuso visākha, vitakketvā vicāretvā pacchā vācaṃ bhindati, tasmā vitakkavicārā vacīsaṅkhāro. The implied akusala is accepted from the Chinese.
