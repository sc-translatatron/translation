# This simile only appears here and at SN 22.102, where it fits better. It is about getting rid of the mud and crap on the reeds, and only incidentally mentions the “top” of the reeds. I’m sceptical about the commentarial explanation that you “beat” the reeds. They’re hollow, and that would ruin them. BHS chorayati has the meaning, “get rid of, remove”, which fits better.
