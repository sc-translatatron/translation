# The verb santharitun is curious here, especially as it relates to a duty of housewives, such as may easily be overlooked or misconstrued by male editors. BB translates without note as “maintain”, perhaps reading sandharitun. But the majority reading, and lectio difficilior, is santharitun. An overly generic rendering devalues women’s work. Comm. says nicchiddaṃ kātuṃ, saṇṭhapetunti attho. Note both Cone and Gradual Sayings have the reading saṇṭhapetun pavattentunti attho. In each of the following sections she directly and specifically addresses the concern. In this case, the concern is addressed by her saying that she is skilled in weaving. Thus it is possible to read this as literally “keeping the house covered in carpets”. (Comm nicchidda, without holes). In earthen and cow-dung plastered homes maintaining the home with coverings is important. Perhaps it is an idiom for “keeping up standards”.
