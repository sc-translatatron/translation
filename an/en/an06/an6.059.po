# BB has “receive” for sadiyeyya, probably influenced by the Vinaya meaning. However the root is “sata”, which clearly means to “enjoy, take pleasure”, and the contexts it is used in in the Suttas, such as this, suggest that this nuance is still applicable. To “receive” money is, rather, patiggahana.
