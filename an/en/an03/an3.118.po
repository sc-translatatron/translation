# BB’s translation misses the point of this admittedly obscure simile. He ignores “apannaka”, which typically means, “whatever way it goes it works out”. And he also skips the critical part of the tika’s comments, which says that the die has four flat sides and two pointed. Not exactly “loaded”, but enough to show the toss is not fair.
